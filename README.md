## Description

### Project
**Wi-Fire** consists of one transmitter unit equipped with an LCD screen and a 4x4 keypad, along with three receiver units, each featuring two firing channels. All units are operated by individual ATmega328P microcontrollers embedded in *Arduino Nano* boards and communicate over a one-to-many network of *nRF24L01+PA+LNA* modules.

### Repository
The code in this repository is organized into two directories, namely [TX](TX) and [RX](RX), which contain the associated code files for the transmitter and the receiver units respectively. Each of these directories is further divided into three subdirectories, which separately include the header (`.h`) files, source (`.cpp`) files, and external libraries.

### Technical Details
This project was developed using *Visual Studio Code* on `Windows 10`, with the *PlatformIO* extension employed to upload the code to the *Arduino* boards. Since this was intended as a one-off project for personal use, no further documentation (e.g. circuit diagrams) was assembled.
